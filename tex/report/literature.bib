	description = {The paper proposes 7 metrics for analyzing a SoftwareArchitecture. These metrics are inspired by the metrics-suite of Chidamer. For each metrics, the author explains the relation with existing metrics and why the metric is useful. The proposed metrics are to be calculated on the softwareArchitecture, the source code is not available in this stage of the development.
	
	There is no formal validation was done for the metrics. The reason for this is that it was not possible to collect both the metrics from the SA and the maintenance data for a single project. This was because there was one project that had maintenance data, but no SA. On the other hand, there as a project that had a SA, but maintenance data would only become available after a few years.},
